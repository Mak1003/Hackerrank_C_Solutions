## 📘 Project Overview  
This repository contains solutions to problems in the **C programming domain** of the platform HackerRank.  
It is designed as a reference and learning tool for developers who want to understand how C-language features (like pointers, arrays, functions, loops, structs/enums) are applied to typical coding challenges.

Challenges are systematically organized by topic, and each solution is implemented in C, following best practices for clarity and readability.
